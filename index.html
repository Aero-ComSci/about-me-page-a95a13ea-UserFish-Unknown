After some contemplation and learning about myself, I yearn to work with video games in the future, so with a sudden motivation, I see learning computer science as a stepping stone or skill to add to my repertoire towards my goal. Now, I plan on taking the computer science pathway, along with other technological and artistic skills, on my journey into college and hope to develop and hone my skills from there on out.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">My name is Chloe Barlow and I am a student coming from Dublin High School. I have had an interest in the STEM field due to personal interests, its influence on modern society, and its complexity. I specifically desire to be a video game designer because of my love for video games and the way that it shaped my childhood. Seeing different art styles and gameplay styles in a video game blew my mind with how expressive and with how many diverse ways it could be used, and when I realized that I was a particularly creative person who loved drawing, I found a middle ground of wanting do something like designing the basis of a game or modeling characters or enemies and such in the video game industry.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">I would like to state that I am a good asset in any sort of working scenario. I take great pride in my work ethic and dedication to assignments and learning new concepts, resulting in my achievement of receiving Principal&rsquo;s Honor Roll every semester since my first year of high school. In addition to that, I am a fast learner and have a curious mind when it comes to solving problems. I can memorize information very quickly in my classes and I have demonstrated resilience in challenging and anxious situations such as performing on stage in Carnegie Hall and maintaining a calm composure with my first mock interview. In a social environment, to those I am close to, I am a loyal friend and considerate to their needs before my own.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c1">I would also like to share that I have been learning a lot about the outside world and how it works. I frequently observe people and their behavior and adjust to their temperament to ensure beneficial interactions. From my experience with working with the Dublin High School Pet Advocacy Welfare Society (DHS PAWS), I have an almost &ldquo;motherly&rdquo; and empathetic side to animals, which can also be applied to my closest friends. And finally, my 10 years of piano class has taught me to be confident in my abilities and that I possess talent and potential if I was able to perform at the esteemed Carnegie Hall.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8">My overall journey is still ambiguous and has room for change and improvisation. I want to take it one step at a time and start with learning the foundations of computer science and improving my artist skills through practice. When the time is right, I&rsquo;ll implement both individually unique skills together to hopefully make a great contribution in the workplace.</span></p></body></html>
